## Segmentation Algorithm
VollSeg is more than just a single segmentation algorithm; it is a meticulously designed modular segmentation tool tailored to diverse model organisms and imaging methods. While a U-Net might suffice for certain image samples, others might benefit from utilizing StarDist, and some could require a blend of both, potentially coupled with denoising or region of interest models. The pivotal decision left to make is how to select the most appropriate VollSeg configuration for your dataset, a question we comprehensively address in our [documentation website](https://kapoorlabs-caped.github.io/vollseg-napari/).

![Algorithm](https://github.com/kapoorlab/VollSeg/blob/main/images/Seg_pipe-git.png)
- **Algorithm**
  - Schematic representation showing the segmentation approach used in VollSeg.
  - First, we input the raw fluorescent image in 3D (A) and preprocess it to remove noise.
  - Next, we obtain the star convex approximation to the cells using Stardist (B) and the U-Net prediction labeled via connected components (C).
  - We then obtain seeds from the centroids of labeled image in B, for each labeled region of C in order to create bounding boxes and centroids.
  - If there is no seed from B in the bounding box region from U-Net, we add the new centroid (in yellow) to the seed pool (D).
  - Finally, we do a marker controlled watershed in 3D using skimage implementation on the probability map shown in (E) to obtain the final cell segmentation result shown in (F).
  - All images are displayed in Napari viewer with 3D display view.
## Requirements

- Python 3.7 and above.
